## Project Description

  Variation on the classic card game, Black-Jack. In the game we made, you play against the dealer in attempts to get cards that total as close to 31 as you can get without going over. All the same rules as original Black-Jack except there is no 'splitting' option. There is also the added option of, after doubling down, you can quad-up and oct-up to 4x or 8x your original bet. The dealer automatically stops adding cards whenever their cards total at least 27.

## Program Design

* Non-Standard libraries
    * pygame module
        * https://www.pygame.org/docs/
        * creates screen and al sprites on the screen, giving users an interface other than the console to play our game
    * random module
        * https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
        * a short description of the module
* Class Interface Design
![class diagram](assets/JBJ_ProgramDesign.png)
* Classes
    * Card
      * model class for creating a card with a value and suit, along with a pygame surface of the oject
    * Deck
      * Contains a list of 104 card objects (2 full decks of playing cards) to be helpful when implementing the controller
    * Player
      * Contains the card objects in the user's hand. Contains functions to add cards to the hand
    * Dealer
      * Subclass of player that keeps track of the dealer's hand
    * Background
      * Loads the background image for the program
    * Button
      * Assists the creation of all clickable button sprites for the program
    * Rules
      * Loads the picture of the rules for the game

## Project Structure

The Project is broken down into the following file structure:

* main.py
* src
    * background.py
    * button.py
    * card.py
    * controller.py
    * dealer.py
    * deck.py
    * player.py
    * rules.py
* assets
    * background.png
    * class_diagram.jpg
    * JBJ_Lose.JPG
    * JBJ_Playing.jpg
    * JBJ_Playing_draft.JPG
    * JBJ_ProgramDesign.jpg
    * JBJ_Rules_Screen.JPG

    * JBJ_StartScreen_draft.png
    * JBJ_StartScreen.jpg
    * JBJ_Win.JPG
* etc

## Tasks and Responsibilities

   * You must outline the team member roles and who was responsible for each class/method, both individual and collaborative.

### Software Lead - John 

Responsible for card.py, deck.py, player.py, dealer.py, and the showdownloop() function that controls all dealer logic when deciding whether the player wins or loses (or ties).
Engineered button.py, rules.py and all GUI aspects of Jack-Black-Jack. Ensured adherence to MVC pattern and that the controller handles all events. Took screenshots of final GUI along with old drafts of the GUI.
Ensured the connection between controller class and all supporting classes. Made sure classes were able to work together to create the final product.

## Testing 

* I wanted to test the program by simulating an average hand of Jack-Black-Jack (JBJ). Unfortunately, to test all of the possibilities, it will take at least 2 games, so I included branching paths in the ATP for the 2 possibilities. 

## ATP

| Step                  | Procedure     | Expected Results  | Actual Results |
| :----------------------:|:-------------| :-----------------| -------------- |
|  1  | Click 'Run' button  | GUI window appears in menu screen  |         |
|  2  | Click 'Rules' button  | Rules of Jack-Black-Jack are displayed (Click rules again to go back to menu) |                 |
|  3A  | Click '+100' button | Bet will go up by 100|                 |
|  3B  | Click '+10' button  | Bet will go up by 10|                 |
|  3C  | Click '-10' button  | Bet will go down by 10 (Unless bet were to go below the minimum bet of 10. Bet will only go as low as 10)|                 |
|  3D  | Click '-100' button  | Bet will go down by 100 (Unless bet were to go below the minimum bet of 10. Bet will only go as low as 10)|                |
|  4  | Click 'Deal' button  | 3 cards added to player's and dealer's hand. 2 of dealer's cards are hidden |                 |
|  5A  | Click 'Hit' button  | Adds additional card to players hand, disables 'Double' option |                  |
|  5B  | Click 'Double' button  | Doubles the original bet of the current hand, displays 'Quad-Up' button, adds card to player's hand, disables 'Hit' option |                  |
|  6  | Click 'Quad-Up' button  | Multiplies the original bet of the current hand by 4, displays 'Oct-Up' button, adds card to player's hand  |                  |
|  7  | Click 'Oct-Up' button  | Multiplies the original bet of the current hand by 8, adds card to player's hand  |                  |
|  8  | Click 'Stand' button  | Reveals all of dealer's cards and brings game to 'SHOWDOWN' state. Dealer logic works itself out and decides if player Loses, Wins, or Ties. |                  |
|  9  | Wait until returned to Betting screen  | User will be able to play click deal again to start a new hand |                  |
|  10 | Click 'Cashout' button  | Game exits, game window closes, and a text file is created with player's total money from the table in it |                  |
